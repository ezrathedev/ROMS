# ROM_HACKING
For those who want to try and alter the gameroms from nintendo entertainment system (NES).

# preparation:
# 1)The actual rom itself(for NES you have to have .nes)
# 2)emulator to emulate the rom, we recommend FCEUX
# 3)A hex editor (HexEdit).
# 4)A tile editor (YY-CHR)

to start you can edit the tiles by opening the .nes file using the tile editor and start looking at the sprites and modify some of them.
